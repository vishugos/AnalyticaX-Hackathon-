# AnalyticaX-Hackathon-
The AnalyticaX Hackathon is a data science competition where participants predict the 
likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The dataset comes from 
the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted by the CDC. The main goal is to 
develop a machine learning model that outputs two probabilities for each person: 
1. vaccine_h1n1 – Probability of receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine. 
2. vaccine_seasonal – Probability of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. 
The competition is a multilabel classification problem, where an individual can receive no 
vaccine, one of the vaccines, or both. Participants will use machine learning techniques to 
analyze features related to demographics, medical history, behavior, and opinions to predict 
vaccination probability.
